What Is Observability?

Observability is the ability to gain deep insights into the internal workings of a system by examining its outputs. This information is crucial for troubleshooting problems, optimizing performance, and improving security. In simpler terms, observability allows you to understand why a system is behaving the way it is.

Observability is the measure of how well the internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. Often confused with monitoring, observability goes a step further by identifying issues in a system and why those issues occur. It’s from control theory and has become super crucial in software engineering, especially with the rise of complex, distributed systems and microservices. Observability collects data from metrics, logs, and traces, the three pillars, to give a complete view of a system’s health and performance.

What is the Difference Between Observability and Monitoring?

Monitoring is a practice of collecting data on system performance and behavior. It’s a crucial part of observability, but it doesn’t provide the same level of insight. Observability goes beyond simple data collection by allowing you to ask questions and explore the root causes of issues.

The three Pillars of Observability


Logs, metrics, and traces are the foundation of any observable system. These three pillars provide different views of system behavior and performance and, when used together, give you complete visibility. Understanding how they work together is key to a good observability strategy. Each pillar provides different data, and when used together, you can see the whole system.


Logs  the WHY
What are Logs?
Logs are the most detailed observability data, capturing individual events within your system. They can be plaintext, structured, or binary, each for different use cases:

Plaintext logs are simple and human-readable.
Structured logs are formatted, making them easier to parse and automate analysis.
Binary logs are more efficient but require special tools to interpret.

Roles of Logs
Logs have several key roles in system monitoring and management. They are essential for:

Real-time monitoring: Immediate visibility into system events.
Troubleshooting: Detailed information to diagnose issues.
Compliance: Tracking changes and access to meet regulatory requirements.
Business analytics: Actionable insights from system operations.

Log Challenges
Despite their importance, logs are a challenge. The volume of log data is overwhelming, leading to high storage costs and performance issues. Processing and analyzing this data requires robust solutions:

Big data: Handling large amounts of log data is resource-hungry.
Performance: High logging can impact system performance.
Cost: Storing and managing lots of log data is expensive.
Treating event logging as a stream processing problem can help with some of these challenges, with tools like Kafka and Humio used for log management and analysis.

Metrics  When and Where
Defining Metrics
Metrics are time series data points. They have evolved to have labels that add dimension and context. For example, CPU usage metrics can be labeled by server, application, or region so you can drill down further. This has made observability metrics a robust real-time monitoring and trend analysis tool.

Benefits of Metrics
Metrics are helpful for:

Dashboards: Creating visualizations that give you an at-a-glance view of system health so you can quickly check-in.
Alerts: Driving real-time notification systems to tell you when something is going wrong.
Mathematical transformations: You can calculate averages or perform anomaly detection to delve deeper into system behavior and performance trends.
Drawbacks of Metrics
But metrics aren’t without their limitations:

High cardinality: Where there are many unique label combinations it can slow down performance and make data analysis harder.
Summarised view: Metrics give you a summarised view of system performance which may not have enough detail for deep-dive diagnostics.
So they’re not great for pinpointing specific issues without additional context from logs or traces.



Traces  What 
Exploring Traces
Traces follow the requests as they flow through a system, capturing related events. This level of detail is key to understanding how different parts of your system interact and where the bottlenecks are. Tracing shows you the journey of a request from start to finish and where things go wrong along the way.

Benefits of Traces
Optimized the request flow to meet service levels.
Easier diagnoses and fixing performance issues = more efficient development and operations.
Tracing challenges
Tracing can be hard and resource-heavy. It often requires:

Manual code changes: Instrumenting the system.
Backend coverage limitations: Traces don’t cover all backend services.
But service meshes are emerging that are solving these challenges by making tracing easier and more comprehensive.



How Metrics, Logs, and Traces Work Together
The combination of metrics, logs, and traces creates an environment for advanced monitoring and problem-solving across IT environments. Each of these three pillars provides unique information, but together they give you a full view of systems and applications.
Observability Metrics are numerical data that measure the operations in a system, like response times, resource usage, and error rates. Logs are detailed records of what happens in the system, providing context and details about operations and events. Traces allow you to follow the journey of a specific request or transaction across different components and services.
When these pieces are connected, IT professionals can cross-reference information quickly.
For example, a spike in a metric can lead a developer to look at the logs at the exact time of the spike to see what was happening on the system. If the logs show an error or an unusual event, traces can be used to follow the path of the affected request to see which services or components were involved and how they interacted.
This cohesive use of data not only speeds up the troubleshooting process but also gives you a better understanding of system behavior in real-world operations.
